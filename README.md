# Grazioso Salvare Dashboard
The Grazioso Salvare Dashboard is a Python and Dash application that connects to a MongoDB database to help identify dogs suitable for search and rescue training.
It includes data filtering, visualization, and mapping tools to support quick and informed decision-making.

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used a modular design and clear documentation to keep the code organized and easy to update. The CRUD Python module separated database logic from the dashboard interface, making the system easier to debug and reuse. 
This module could be adapted for other data-driven apps, such as adoption tracking or shelter management tools.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I start by analyzing the problem and breaking it down into smaller tasks. such as database setup, data retrieval, visualization, and interface design. Compared to other course assignments, this one required more focus on user experience.
In future projects, I'll continue using modular design, iterative testing, and clear requirement analysis to meet goals.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create tools that turn data into useful insights. In this project, the dashboard helps Gazioso Salvare quickly identify and train suitable dogs, improving efficiency and reducing human error.
Projects like this show how computing colutions can make real-world systems faster and more effective.
